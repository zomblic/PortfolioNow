-----> Clicked Link
Work smartered, not harder option!
Go ahead and browse my silly website! I still want to do quite a bit, but once I gain the knowledge needed!



-----> Had to do it the hard way? Really?
In your terminal, the farthest out folder, meaning the folder that contains all the code, open your terminal and type 'npm i'. Wait a few mintues as all the dependencies install, including vite. Still in the terminal, type 'npm run build' and the, 'npm run start' it will kickstart and automatically load. Snoop and then you're done!

    To the bootcamp for providing the readme for the assignment,

    Classmates for forming study groups to problem solve and figure it out -- thanks to Nick D for helping with debugging, discussing and catching the syntax for the weather service!
    Tutors and TAs for being patient and helping us out,

    Google (and the many, many, many websites that offered advice, tibits and a variety of coding exmaples-- StackOverflow and GeekdforGeeks mainly),

    Co-Pilot, ChatGPT and Xpert for identifying debugging and slightly tweaking (not sure how to succesfully cite debugged code tho) as well as breaking down code, explaining it and over several examples.
    
    Once again calling on CHATGPT for taking my gibberish and creatintg and implementing and explain the cyberpunk css! I was at a loss at how to do it and they showed me!
