        Zomblic is a sleep deprived zombie who is learning about the world of coding. While their ADHD finds all the differetn colors amusing they find they struggle in retaining information. As they are a zombie. Zomblic last tested their general writing spped and was satisified it was the 100 word area. However, they are currently working on coding typing spped. This causes their fingers to get lost on the keep board. When not learning to code and the horrors of all things javascript, you can find them rediscovering their lack of skill in house building/interior design within the Sims 4, or casually learning all the ways they can die via various other videogames.
